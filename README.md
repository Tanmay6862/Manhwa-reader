# Manhwa Preview (GitHub-ready)

This repository contains a static preview of the ManhwaWorld homepage + reader.

## Files
- `index.html` — homepage (static)
- `reader.html` — vertical reader sample
- `vercel.json` — Vercel configuration for static deployment
- `package.json` — placeholder to satisfy Vercel

## Deploy to Vercel (one-click)
1. Create a GitHub repository and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. Go to https://vercel.com/new and import your GitHub repo.
3. Vercel will detect a static project. Set the framework to **Other** / **Static**.
4. Deploy. After deployment, your site will be served at `https://<your-project>.vercel.app`.

## Replace images
If you want to replace the sample images with your own, overwrite the `src` URLs in `index.html` and `reader.html`, commit and re-deploy on Vercel.
